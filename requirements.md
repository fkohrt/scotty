# porter

`porter` is a WebSocket-based PDF viewer.

## MVP Functionalities
- One client ("host") uploads a PDF to server
- Host is redirected to a `room` with its own UUID `id` and a pdf nav bar (prev & next pages, page number, etc.)
    - Room ID is part of a shareable URL: `https://raa-porter.com/?room=123456789`
- When other clients join, their pointers are visible on page
- Everyone has permission to navigate through PDF, updating everone else's view (ie. there's only 1 "current page", but every participant can navigate, so it's not a presenter-presentee situation).

### WebSocket Data
Client sends to server:
- user ID (generated by front end)
- that user's mouse coordinate
- If page changes, send new page number

Server sends to everyone else:
- Everyone else's mouse coordinate
- Current page number

### Important Considerations
- Internal presentations contain confidential information, so PDFs should be treated with caution
    - PDFs should temporarily be hosted on S3
    - S3 object read access is only granted to `porter` url and room id (so even other teams can't randomly snoop around)
    - S3 object should be deleted when room is empty (ie. meeting is done)
    - `porter` will need authentication (can use Google OAuth & screen for `@raai.com` addresses)
- Room IDs are only stored in memory and deleted when everyone leaves
    - Also if using free heroku, memory is wiped when instance goes to sleep
- Always use HTTPs

## Additional Functionalities
This app should be as light as possible. It's not supposed to be comparable to Google Slides or screen sharing through video conferencing tools, just an easy way to run through a document such that everyone is on the same page.

That said, some lightweight additions to consider:
- Upload multiple PDFs
- Clients can annotate
- Clients can add comments

## Dependencies
(Other than the boilerplate)
- [react-pdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pdf)
- [socket.io](https://socket.io/)
